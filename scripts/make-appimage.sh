# Makes dist/ScarletNX-linux-<arch>.AppImage, a runtime that runs on any Linux, with pkgforge's quick-sharun
# (https://github.com/pkgforge-dev/Anylinux-AppImages): it bundles the runtime with every library it loads, SDL3, the
# Vulkan loader and Mesa's Vulkan drivers included. CI runs it in pkgforge's Arch container after `cmake --install`
# into /usr (.github/workflows/build.yml), and quick-sharun has to be on PATH (pkgforge-dev/anylinux-setup-action puts
# it there).
#
# A copy named after a game works like the bare runtime: games/Catherine.AppImage (or games/Catherine) loads
# games/Catherine_code.so, since the runtime takes its name and folder from $APPIMAGE.
